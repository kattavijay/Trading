stock analysis automation project using Python, powered by Yahoo Finance, Pandas, and more! With these enhancements,
I can dive even deeper into stock data analysis, leveraging the robust capabilities of Yahoo Finance and the flexibility of Pandas.
Now, not only can I fetch live stock prices and 52-week highs, but I can also perform advanced data manipulation and analysis with Pandas, 
unlocking insights and trends that were previously hidden. Thanks to these powerful libraries, my stock analysis workflow is more efficient and insightful than ever before!
Stay tuned for even more enhancements as I continue to refine and improve my automated stock analysis tool.

You can find couple of dashboards in here all are implementation stage ... only one dashboard stock_price.py is available on beta release.

feel free to  fork the repo and experiment.
